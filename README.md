# Science Education Platform

An interactive science education platform with simulations for physics, biology, and chemistry. The platform features Bangla language support and audio narration.

## Overview

This project provides a complete web-based science education platform with three interactive engines:

1. **Physics Engine**: Simulate mechanics like projectile motion and pendulum with adjustable parameters
2. **Biology Engine**: Explore 3D models of biological systems with interactive tooltips
3. **Chemistry Engine**: Perform virtual chemistry experiments with visual reactions

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   # OR
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:8000.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173.
